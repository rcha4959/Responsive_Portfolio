            <p>Hello All, My name is Rakesh and I am an enthusiast, what that means? I think it means that I love to live to the fullest. Take life kicks and butss as challenge and move on with full swing.
              I came to Australia in 2005 as a student and pursused my studies in commerce and engineering, and tried to find a stabel career but unfortunately I am still looking for that solid career, may be its idea of career thats screwing me around lol.
              I am excited to finally learn a skill and step in to the work force, theoritical studies were good but I believe every body needs a skill to be able to be productive in a society.
              So here I am trying to gain a valuable skill. My idea is to step in to tech industry work for couple of years gain the knowledge and expertise and start my own business. And thats what I have always wanted- START MYOWN BUSINESS. If I can combine web design and data science together to build a solid tech company would be awesome,
              but at this moment the idea of an interesting business would do.
              I worked in finance  to construction to mining and collaborated with different kinds of peopel. What I have learned so far is that people respect those who can provide value to others life, and that what I am aiming to do in every day life- provide value or adding value to people and businesses. My way of doing that is to empower myself first then empower others to be the best that they can.
              One of my areas of interest is mindfullness and yoga, I have been practicing meditation and yoga for few years and there are clearly benefits, but the main challenge is to create life circumstances in such a way to benefit life.
              Now, little bit about starting the web development course; I initially enrolled to study data science then changed my mind to learn coding because I thought the basic skill of coding will enable me to later pick up other programming languages. As I mentioned earlier, my ultimate intention is to combine python and coding together to start a data management and analysis business and I know that is atleast 5 years away and I will be 41 :D 
              haha never mind I am still young and functioning.
              This is my first ever website building experience and I can say its frustrating at times and hard but I am enjoying the learning aspect of it and it keeps me stimulated. I can't wait to learn and start a new career.
